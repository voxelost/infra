# project ideas
- a webserver for automatic discovery and provisioning of new nodes -> when a new node appears on the local network and responds to predicate calls, automatically provision it and add it to the cluster
- a platform webapp for managing cluster nodes
- automatic infra graphing tool with something like https://github.com/mingrammer/diagrams; allowing for easy display of the current infrastructure as well as interactive monitoring and management of nodes
